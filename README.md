# Soft-Robotic-Gripper- a brief description about this work
Soft Robotic Gripper consists of inflatable parts that allow the flexibility to be able to grab objects
it is used by the people having peripheral nerve damage who lacks touch and grip and this gripper provides strong grip and
it can lift up to different weights dependence on dimensions of the gripper
# Working Principle
The working principle of the gripper is Pneumatic Actuation. This involves the use of pressurized air orother gases to inflate or deflate chambers within the gripper, causing it to open or close its fingers and it can bend in different directions.
# Limitations
This prototype cannot hold very heavy objects yet since its thickness is small so a larger sized prototype can help.
The flexibility and the rigidity of the LSR is lower compared to the Eco-Flex which restricts the bending and inflation of the gripper
